## Refactoring code for theming the app

Before our styling/theming code gets out of control, let's find a way to keep things DRY. First, let's try to get a theming system in place.

<Code>yarn add emotion-theming</Code>

Wrap our app root with a ThemeProvider, and now we can access theme variables from any emotion styled components!

## A consistent and scalable way of defining styles

We have been using Emotion for styling up the app so far. That solved the problem of being able to write css-like styles in React Native, while emotion-theming solves the problem of having a maintainable theming system.

Before we build out more screens and component, we need a consistent way of defining styles like padding, margin, typography, and colours.

Let's try styled-system!

<Code>yarn add styled-system</Code>

First, let's create a few generic but very reusable primitive components:

## Reconfiguring our navigation stack for adding logged-in screens

We want all users that are not logged in to see an introduction, register and login screens. After the user has logged in, we want to show a tabbed navigation.

First, let's reconfigure our navigation stack:

### AuthStackNavigator (Stack)

- IntroScreen
- RegisterScreen
- Login Screen

### MainTabNavigator (Tabs)

- SitterStackNavigator
- SitterListScreen
- ChatStackNavigator
- ChatScreen
- ProfileStackNavigator
- ProfileScreen

This allows us to show the welcome/auth screens if a user has not logged in. After logging in, we show the MainTabNavigator which has all the other screens.

### Preparing UserContext and a useAuthed hook in anticipation of authentication features down the line

We will use React.Context to globally store the user logged in state. Its a lot easier compared to using a state management library like Redux.

We also create a useAuthed custom hook for handling the auth response from our server later on. For now, lets set a mock user on auth.

After doing all that, here's what we have:
