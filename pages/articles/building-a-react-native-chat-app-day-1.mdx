## Day 1

Today we will be building an APP and a WEBSITE where dog owners can chat with potential sitters.

This tutorial assumes that you have a basic to intermediate understanding of:

- Javascript / Typescript and
- React / React Native

## Project name

PawChat

## Project requirements

- As a pet owner, I should be able to sign up/log in to my account
- As a dog sitter, I should be able to sign up/log in to my account
- As a dog owner, I should be able to see a list of dog sitters
- As a pet owner, I should be able to chat with a dog sitter
- As a dog sitter, I should be able to see a list of dog owners
- As a dog sitter, I should be able to chat with a dog owner
- As a user, I should be able to upload dog photos
- As a user, given I am not online, I should get a notification if a message arrives
- All the features above should be replicated on the web, and be in-sync with the mobile app

## Users

- Pet owner - Michele
- Dog sitters - Elise and Imy
- Dog - Perry

Let's begin with the mobile app.

### Step 1: INSTALL EXPO.

Expo enables us to build iOS and Android apps using Javascript and React Native without installing XCode or Android Studio.

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli expo init
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new Expo project with the name PawChat. I like to start with the blank (TypeScript) template.

### Step 2: SET UP THE INTRO, REGISTER, AND LOGIN SCREEN.

I like using emotion because it makes writing styles in React Native feel like writing CSS… so, let’s install that:

```bash
yarn add @emotion/core @emotion/native
```

This is how it's supposed to look like:

<Flex>
  <ArticleImage mr={2} width="31%" src="/assets/pawchat-intro.png" />
  <ArticleImage mr={2} width="31%" src="/assets/pawchat-register.png" />
  <ArticleImage width="31%" src="/assets/pawchat-login.png" />
</Flex>

Next, we set up a navigation system for the auth screens.

### Step 3: SET UP A SIMPLE INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE (IA) FOR THIS APP

AuthenticationStack

- IntroScreen
- RegisterScreen
- Login Screen

MainStack

- (All other screens will be set up later)

We will use the react-navigation library to achieve this.

```bash
  yarn add @react-navigation/core @react-navigation/stack @react-native-community/masked-view
```

Install some Expo libraries thats needed by react-navigation...

```bash
expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```

The end result that we want to achieve:
