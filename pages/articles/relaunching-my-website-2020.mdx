## Improvements

### Simplify the design

- Remove illustrations and coloured strokes (simplify)
- Replace product screenshots with logos/icons (simplify)
- Replace case study pages with blog articles (timeless)

### Update the tech

- JavaScript → TypeScript
- Next.js 8.0 → 9.0 (static rendering)
- Bootstrap → Chakra.ui (accessible)
- CSS → emotion + styled-system

## Design inspirations

Let's get into it. As usual, the first step is to look for something to copy...

I love these two designer-dev pairs (Brian-Max + Chris-James). They work together to ship really thoughtful products and have been my design + code inspiration for the past few years.

## Minimalist design

All the sites above uses a lot of emoji ✌instead of icons and illustrations.
They also use a single font: system-ui which evokes familiarity.

While the designs look basic, I will choose function over form any day.

## Dark mode

Looks like a lot of people are beginning to support dark mode. I've also noticed that accent colours are usually orange on dark mode. Probably influenced by iOS?

I do like the hot pink on the Music app though. I will choose this as my accent colour because I'm Asian. I love anything red!

## Designing in code

For personal projects, I move a lot faster by designing in code. I like to start with content and layout. Let's spin up a new next.js project and get started!
