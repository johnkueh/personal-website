## Improvements

### Simplify the design

- Remove illustrations and coloured strokes (simplify)
- Replace product screenshots with logos/icons (simplify)
- Replace case study pages with blog articles (timeless)

### Update the tech

- JavaScript → TypeScript
- Next.js 8.0 → 9.0 (static rendering)
- Bootstrap → Chakra.ui (accessible)
- CSS → emotion + styled-system

## Design inspirations

Let's get into it. As usual, the first step is to look for something to copy...

<Flex flexWrap="wrap">
  <ArticleImage width="50%" src="/assets/brian-lovin.png" />
  <ArticleImage width="50%" src="/assets/max-stoiber.png" />
  <ArticleImage width="50%" src="/assets/chris-sealey.png" />
  <ArticleImage width="50%" src="/assets/james-toohey.png" />
</Flex>

I love these two designer-dev pairs (Brian-Max + Chris-James). They work together to ship really thoughtful products and have been my design + code inspiration for the past few years.

## Minimalist design

All the sites above uses a lot of emoji ✌instead of icons and illustrations.
They also use a single font: system-ui which evokes familiarity.

While the designs look basic, I will choose function over form any day.

## Dark mode

Looks like a lot of people are beginning to support dark mode. I've also noticed that accent colours are usually orange on dark mode. Probably influenced by iOS?

<Flex justifyContent="center" flexWrap="wrap">
  <ArticleImage width="33%" src="/assets/ios-clock.png" />
  <ArticleImage width="33%" src="/assets/ios-news.png" />
  <ArticleImage width="33%" src="/assets/ios-watch.png" />
</Flex>

I do like the hot pink on the Music app though. I will choose this as my accent colour because I'm Asian. I love anything red!

<Flex justifyContent="center" flexWrap="wrap">
  <ArticleImage width="33%" src="/assets/ios-music.png" />
  <ArticleImage width="33%" src="/assets/ios-music-search.jpeg" />
</Flex>

## Designing in code

For personal projects, I move a lot faster by designing in code. I like to start with content and layout. Let's spin up a new next.js project and get started!

```bash
npx create-next-app
```

<ArticleImage src="/assets/nextjs.png" />

I like to start with content first. After adding Chakra-UI,
I removed the default Next.js page and started adding content:

<ArticleImage src="/assets/website-content-only.png" />

After that, I started to bring in typography, spacing and colors:

<ArticleImage src="/assets/website-typography-spacing-colors.png" />

Adding navigation bar and call to actions:

<ArticleImage src="/assets/website-nav-cta.png" />

Adding more design details:

<ArticleImage src="/assets/website-completed.png" />

### Content management

I like keeping content as markdown files within the source code on GitHub because of how portable it is.

<ArticleImage width={400} src="/assets/markdown-cms.png" />

MDX is a new markdown format which lets you import React components within the .md document

## End result + dark mode

<ArticleImage
  borderWidth="1px"
  borderColor="gray.300"
  src="/assets/website-end-full-page.png"
/>
