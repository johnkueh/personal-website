- I founded this company. I am the solo developer that created the whole platform - a content management system (CMS), and a system to produce white-labelled apps.
- Supported audio tour apps from the biggest tourist attractions in Australia - Sydney Opera House, Australian Museum, Sydney Living Museums and more!
- CMS front end was built in React.js, backend in Ruby on Rails. Audio tour apps were created using React Native and Expo
- I did customer development, wrote user stories and managed customer accounts in Trello
