- I worked with 2 other developers to help build out the new Zibbet platform using Ember.js and Ruby on Rails.
- Very well tested codebase, PR reviews for every feature release.
- I did backend work on subscription billing system (Braintree), worker jobs running on a schedule (Sidekiq) and frontend work coding up designed components.
- Worked with the team via a Kanban-style product backlog on Asana.

Full case study coming soon
