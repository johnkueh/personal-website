                  Big Wâ€™s Great Eggscape Treasure Hunt involved deploying five
                  beacons in 183 Big W stores Australia-wide. Once the app was
                  downloaded, visitors selected which â€˜eggâ€™ they wanted to find,
                  and a hot/cold meter in the app guided them to the beacon.
